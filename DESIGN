Fig is for configuration management.

Introduction

Meant to be deployed within your network, Fig runs on CouchDB.
TODO: mention something about HA


Configuration management is one of the most important components of any web
application. <TODO: link to that article I sent marcel about shipping trunk>

In general, most applications will be running in multiple environments.
Development, Testing/Integration, and Production is a common example. This
scenario is naturally hierarchical, and so Fig organizes TODO ...

Overview

When a user opens Fig, the first thing she'll see is a list of your Projects.
Each Project is a distinct component of your infrastructure. For example, your
web application and a backend service may each have different entries in the
list of Projects.

Clicking into a project will show its Root Settings page.

| e  |   ________   |
| e  |  | group2 |  |

|____|______________|

The Groups pane contains logical groupings of parts of your project. For
example: Database, AB tests, or maybe a very specific piece of logic, i.e.
Reccomendation Engine.

Each group contains Settings relevant to that Group, which we'll go into later.


On the left is the Tree pane, which relates to the hierachy of Environments as
described above. It looks like this:

_________________
| Root           |
|   Development  |
|     mhooker    |
|   Integration  |
|   Production   |
|________________|

Clicking on any node of the Tree will change which Environment the Settings in
the Group pane describe.
